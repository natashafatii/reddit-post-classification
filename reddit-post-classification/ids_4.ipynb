        "\n",
        "**Steps:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **API Connection:**  \n",
        "   - Load Reddit API credentials from environment variables (`CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, `USER_AGENT`).  \n",
        "   - Establish a read-only connection to Reddit using `praw.Reddit()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Subreddit Selection:**  \n",
        "   - The script targets multiple subreddits: `r/technology`, `r/mentalhealth`, and `r/AskReddit`.  \n",
        "   - For each subreddit, it fetches **20 posts**, ignoring stickied posts.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Data Collection:**  \n",
        "   For each post, the following information is extracted:\n",
        "   - **Title**\n",
        "   - **Body**\n",

        "   - **Number of upvotes**\n",
        "   - **Number of comments**\n",
        "   - **Timestamp (UTC)**\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Data Storage and Export:**  \n",
        "   - All collected posts are stored in a **Pandas DataFrame** for easy manipulation.  \n",
        "   - Data is sorted by subreddit and upvotes for a cleaner preview.  \n",
        "   - The raw data is exported to `raw_reddit_data.csv`.\n"
