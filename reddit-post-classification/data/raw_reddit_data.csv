mentalhealth,"My college roommate’s porn addiction spiraled so badly he got kicked out of the dorms, and I still don’t know how to process it","So… this is something I never expected to write, but after everything that happened this semester, I need to get it out of my system.

I go to a pretty normal mid-sized university. Nothing fancy. At the start of the year, housing assigned me a random roommate—let’s call him *D*. When we first met, he seemed quiet, awkward, but friendly enough. He was a comp-sci major who mostly kept to himself, liked energy drinks a little too much, and played a ton of gacha games. Honestly, he reminded me of half the guys I know.

Everything seemed normal for the first month. He’d stay up late, but whatever—college. Then slowly… things got weird.

At first, I noticed he’d close his laptop really fast whenever I walked in. Again… fine. We’re all adults. But it kept happening. Sometimes at 3–4 AM when I’d wake up to use the bathroom and see the glow of his screen. Then I started finding tissues on the desk, earbuds on the floor, his laptop open with incognito tabs still visible. Awkward, but not a crisis… until it escalated.

The dude stopped going to class. Not just here and there—like WEEKS at a time. He barely left the room except to grab vending machine snacks. I’d come back from lectures and hear… very obvious audio coming from behind his headphones. Even when I made noise, even when I said I was entering. He just didn’t care anymore.

The turning point was when our RA did room inspections.

I had warned him the night before, and he said “yeah yeah, don’t worry.” Spoiler: he absolutely *did not* worry.

The RA knocked, we said come in, and D—**I swear to god**—still had a video playing on his screen. Full volume because his headphones had unplugged slightly. The RA just froze. I froze. D froze about two seconds later when he realized it wasn’t me who walked in.

The RA told him to close it, but you could tell he was trying to be professional while dying inside.

After that, we got a meeting scheduled with housing. I thought he’d get a warning. What I *didn’t* know was that this wasn’t D’s first report.

Apparently other people on our floor had complained earlier about weird noises through the walls, late-night slamming sounds, and someone seeing explicit content on his screen through the door window when walking past. They had talked to him before and he brushed it off.

Housing sent him to counseling. He skipped. They set up another meeting. He didn’t go. They warned him he could lose his dorm privileges if he kept violating behavior rules.

He kept doing it.

Fast-forward a bit: two weeks later, at around midnight, he was watching stuff with the volume ON—like, full speakers—because he “thought I wouldn’t be back for a while.” Someone on our floor called the RA again. This time it went straight up the chain.

Three days later, he was officially removed from on-campus housing for repeated conduct violations and refusing to comply with the support plan they tried to create for him. They gave him 24 hours to pack and leave.

It left me weirdly shaken. I can’t tell if I feel sorry for him, frustrated, secondhand embarrassed, or all of the above.

Anyway… thanks to anyone who actually read all this. I just needed to unload the story somewhere.",Levitating_Moose,290,40,2025-12-01 20:27:28+00:00
mentalhealth,Are men under 30 ruined?,"I’m in my early 50s. White dude from a small farm town. My generation had its problems. Divorce. Alcoholism. Drug abuse. Bullying. Abusive parents. Dysfunctional extended family. School authorities were corrupt. Cops sucked. The most repugnant edgelords of my generation were probably Nirvana and Beavis and Butthead - both culturally cataclysmic. They seemed to point out a problem with cathartic noise or a healthy sense of humor. But being stupid, ignorant or mean was never a cause to be celebrated. The cultural implication seemed to be that those traits were still meant to be resisted and aged out of. Until then, skateboarding and playing rock ‘n’ roll would get me through.

It was a fucking paradise compared to now. I’m speaking of the post-internet reality for young men specifically.

The lives of men raised online seem to have been completely retarded. Their lives were deprived of the development of mirror neurons or authentic chances to experience empathy or whatever family system they grew up in was completely usurped by the internet and video games and people behaving very, very, very badly online. Either way, the result seems to be that their moral compass is based on the indulgence of other people’s worst fantasies.

Now it is completely normal for someone to go online and spew the most dissociated, vile hate I’ve ever had the displeasure of being witness to.

Nirvana and Beavis and Butthead gave way to the “I don’t care if you don’t care” attitude of the 2000s which gave way to 4Chan and the celebration of not just ignorance, but of abject cruelty. I argue it's what has landed us here.

I know that there are always generational divides. I’m aware that this could be construed simply as a “get off my lawn” letter. But I always have always advocated for kids - especially when other adults didn't. ""Adults"" don’t know what they’re doing most of the time anyway.

But this recent thing - this is not “you crazy kids with your loud music and your long hair running off to rock concerts, getting drunk on the weekends or dropping out of school to travel in Europe.” It’s not “I’m worried about this rap or Satanic Heavy Metal music you listen to” or “you play too much Nintendo - go outside and ride your bike.”

This is celebrating Hitler. Incels. Groypers. It’s the glorification of hate and the killing of other people - specifically the most vulnerable among us.

This seems to be a completely ubiquitous epidemic of mental illness the likes of which we have never seen as a species, but it seems to be the only perceivable reality for certain young men.

Entire generations are throwing their lives into the meat grinder of a 24 hour news cycle. Seems to me that's nothing but a dark fiction with a shit ending for everyone. But I also don’t see this going away with the wisdom of old age. I argue that we either fix this or we fix nothing.

Young men - am I wrong or right? If so, please tell me why.",[deleted],171,131,2025-12-02 07:17:07+00:00
mentalhealth,I've ruined my life at the age of 19,"I'm 19 in my second year of college and I already feel like my life is ruined. Completely worthless. I hate my life because of the things I've done. I have a porn addiction that just wont go away. I can go clean for 5 days straight but then by the sixth day I explode and watch porn 3 - 4 times in one day and I feel horrible. I go on social media apps speaking to multiple different girls hoping they'll send me nudes, I did this all throughout high school as well. I feel awful about it and everything I've ever done. I'm a monster in my own eyes. Relationships don't work for me, I have no confidence in myself and girls can see that. I'm starting to think about taking the easy way out more often as it would be so much easier than having to think about who I am as a person. I hate everything about me. I'm ruined and I don't see a way to continue without being partially depressed all the time.

mentalhealth,Bf’s mom covered my mouth while im having panic attacks. Is that abuse?,"Hi everyone. I really need an outside perspective because I feel shaken, confused, and honestly scared. I’m staying with my family right now, trying to process everything.

A few days ago I had a severe panic attack, the worst one I’ve ever had. Honestly idk becahse it was my first time experiencing it. My whole body froze up, I couldn’t move, I was crying uncontrollably, and I felt like I couldn’t breathe. I genuinely thought I was going to pass out. I thought i was having a stroke because my mom and grandpa had it. No one in the family has ever had mental health issues like panic attack so this is new to me.

My boyfriend tried to “handle” me for about an hour, but then he suddenly got frustrated. I kept begging him to take me to the hospital because I couldn’t breathe or move, but he refused. My mom lives 3 hours away and called him in the middle of the night, telling him to take me to the ER immediately — he still refused. He insisted I’d “be better at home” and told me he didn’t want to “wait in line at the ER for this.”

I told him I was terrified and begged, “Please don’t leave me alone, I’m scared,” and he said, “No, I’m tired of dealing with you.” Then he left me alone, closed the door, and almost turned off all the lights while I was frozen and screaming for help.

I kept crying and yelling that I couldn’t breathe. He eventually came back, not to help, but to yell: “Are you trying to get me arrested?! You’re waking the basement tenants!”

The next morning things got even worse. His mom came over, immediately yelling at me while I was still shaking, crying, and unable to move properly. At one point she said, “If you don’t stop, I’m going to slap you,” and then she covered my mouth with her hand while I was crying and struggling to breathe. And said oh you need to be taken away and be in a psych for a week.

I can’t describe how terrifying that felt. I literally could not move, can’t stop crying even though my brain wants to stop and someone put their hand over my mouth.

When my body slipped partly off the bed, they laughed and said, “Oh, now you can move.” His mom kept provoking me by saying, “What do you want to do, punch me?” “Go ahead punch me right now” while I could barely talk.

My boyfriend eventually said you can’t treat her like how you treat me. And she was flabbergasted. After i was taken to the hospital which was 12 hrs after the incident even though i was begging for 12 hrs to take me to the hospital, my family came to get me. So i slept with my family the whole time after. The next day he messaged me and said, “If you weren’t being a bitch, you’d be comfortable in bed and jn the office in the house right now.” In a very sarcastic tone.

I left and I’m staying with my family now. I don’t feel safe going back, but I also feel confused and guilty. I keep replaying everything and questioning myself.

Was this abuse? Or am I overreacting because I was scared and having a panic attack? They kept saying to me that they just didnmt know how to handle it that’s why thats there reaction. I genuinely need honest perspective",Psychological_Ant747,60,61,2025-12-02 12:09:17+00:00

mentalhealth,Point of life?,"Hi, I'm 15, struggling with mental health. My life feels very difficult at the moment and I actually just wanna know what I'm doing all this for?

I'm not religious, I don't believe in any god and don't want to. (For very good reasons. But I'm not in the mood to have discussions about that)

What's the point of life? Why am I here

I'm sorry if this is the wrong community to post this in but idk where else to post it.

Idk if this helps: I'm in therapy and taking medication prescribed by my psychiatrist. I have an autistic burnout. I'm always overstimulated, that's what the meds are for, but they don't help. I think i have social anxiety and now I'm too scared to go to school. the anxiety makes my burnout worse. 
I don't have any hobbies, I spend my days lying in bed or walking around my room while listening to music. I don't enjoy doing anything and I don't have friends. There's nothing I look forward to which makes it quite difficult to wanna live, so I REALLY need a reason to live or a point in life.

mentalhealth,how do i stop caring so much about myself?,"for the last few years i’ve been stuck in this loop of hating everything about myself. i keep trying hobbies (crocheting, painting, random diy stuff) hoping they’ll distract me from thinking about how i look or how dumb i feel… but honestly it just makes me feel worse. i end up thinking i’m even more useless because i suck at those things too.

the part that hurts the most is how i feel when i look at myself. i get so disgusted. i don’t even feel like a woman, just because i think i’m too ugly. i feel like literally nothing about me is good—every single part of me is messed up or ugly.

it makes me jealous of other women, and i hate that feeling. i’ve become so bitter watching everyone else be prettier, like there’s no point in my life if i look like this.

and it’s not just appearance. i feel stupid, like my personality is awful. i don’t really have close friends. just one, and we’re not that close. i’ve never had a boyfriend either, and it just makes me feel like my life is already over before it even started.

i’ve been feeling like this for around 3 years. i know therapy would probably help but i’m honestly terrified of going, and the therapists around where i live don’t seem great anyway.

i just… don’t know how to stop caring so much about myself in this toxic way. how do people do it? any advice?",XKXKXKXXKXKXK,6,7,2025-12-02 18:06:30+00:00

I’ve been struggling with severe depression and suicidal ideation for a while and it’s only continued to get worse everything I’ve tried hasn’t helped much I’ve started working out trying to eat better but it still hasn’t helped I want to get help I just don’t want to use meds due to horrible experiences with them in the past,W00zers,5,3,2025-12-02 13:48:00+00:00
mentalhealth,"Incident happened with mom, now I am remembering things.","I am 43(M) if that matters. 

About a month ago, I went to my parents' house to visit my mom. I knew dad was at work, but was just stopping by to say hello. Walked in on mom with another man. Anger instantly went through the roof, I told the guy to get dressed and get TF out. 

I yelled at mom, very harshly. She needed to hear those words, and after I left I have not been in contact with her whatsoever. Dad is doing OK.  Much better than I would be in this situation. 

  
It took me a solid two weeks to calm my mind down about that situation to be able to form rational thoughts about things. In doing this, bits and pieces from the past, say when I was age 7 - 12 keep popping into my mind, and when thinking about them now, it sure seems like mom has been cheating on dad for a while. 

  
I keep having random memories come out now since that day, and I don't know how to feel about it. Is my own personal mental health collapsing? I can still function just fine daily, it just is worrisome that I can just be plugging away at work and all of a sudden, my brain is in 1992 and a confused kid.  Easy enough to snap out of, but it is something I am not familiar with. 

Is this common after an incident like this?

mentalhealth,I can't enjoy anything that's even remotely popular.,"I can't, but I'd want to enjoy things, like a normal human. Whenever something I do like gets brought up, I feel like I enjoy that thing less and less. There's also a reaction, like I'm threatened, I feel kinda stressed out and a little angry. I don't want to be like that. I don't know what tags to add, because I doubt that anyone could help with this. Maybe I'm not meant to enjoy anything.

mentalhealth,im thinking about giving up. i dont know who to reach out to,"
<18 f. i had to move to england 5 or so years ago from my home country due to political issues. ever since ive arrived i have felt the pressure to try extra hard since i felt like i was born with some sort of disadvantage compared to my friends who were born and raised in this country

this has recently gotten worse with exams. i began harming myself a year ago now, and i also have other coping mechanisms which im too ashamed to admit.

i dont know what to do. ive thought about giving up multiple times. nothing i do feels enough. im never happy with my grades or my talents or my extracurriculars. i dont see a future ahead of myself. 

i dont know how healthcare works here. my parents are already struggling and i dont want them to also pay money for my mental health. the free healthcare (nhs) has long queues and i dont exactly know how it works (like ive said) at some point considering reaching out began feeling pointless too.

i feel like im becoming a bad person. i feel jealous when my friends perform well, and i cant feel sorry for them when they vent about their problems (because in my head ""what theyre experiencing is nowhere bad enough"") i never tell this to them. i dont want to hurt the people around me but i can understand that these are not good thoughts to have. i am insecure.

i doubt many people will see this. i dont really know why im posting this here. it just feels like im living a life that nobody else can relate to and nobody else can truly understand. i just want to be happy with myself and i tried so hard to but i cant. im tired.

im meant to map out a future for myself by now. focus on my academics, my connections, my skills. but i cant see one for myself at all. my life feels like a waste

what do i do? is there anything i can do?",KittyMuffinx,3,3,2025-12-02 19:31:59+00:00

mentalhealth,surviving school with MDD,"I am a 16 (almost 17) year old girl in my junior year of hs. My entire life I’ve subconsciously known that something was a little off with me mentally. I used to be really emotionally reserved even though I had many friends and I always felt that I have low self worth. It got a lot worse/apparent during Covid but then during middle school it kind of “went away” (although I now know that it never went away but rather always stayed at the back of my mind). Fast forward to the end of my sophomore year and I started skipping school because of my mental health but I was still able to keep up with my grade; I was getting A’s while taking AP classes. This year, I have taken 7 AP classes because that is what it takes to keep my rank in the top 5 percent (but now I have dropped a bit lower). In the past three weeks my mental health has gotten SIGNIFICANTLY worse and all of a sudden I have no motivation, extreme fatigue, and I am CONSTANTLY in a state of depression. Any happiness I feel is fleeting and very rare. For the first time in my life I am failing all of my classes and I have around 13 absences. I was diagnosed with MDD yesterday and I’m scared. I don’t want to fail my classes because my entire life I’ve been a straight A student and I want to go to a relatively good college. My school counselor has been no help when it comes to me keeping up with my classwork and my teachers, to my surprise, have not noticed that anything is wrong even though I went from A’s to failing (I’m talking like getting 25’s in some classes rn).

They get extremely attached to one person at a time (non-romantically) and rely on them for almost all emotional support. It becomes overwhelming, and then they feel abandoned when people need space — which creates a painful cycle.

They often say they have no friends or that nobody cares about them, even though there are people who try to include them and support them. But they’ll turn down invitations, avoid social events, and then feel rejected anyway. When I or others try to do something nice or supportive for them, they sometimes respond with frustration because it wasn’t done exactly the way they imagined.

There’s also a pattern of emotional outbursts — slamming things, shutting down, or getting irritated over small things not going how they expected. It’s become really draining for me, to the point that my own mental well-being is being affected.

I’ve offered emotional support, practical help, and even tried suggesting professional help, but they don’t want to pursue it. It’s like they want things to magically improve without changing anything.

I care about this person a lot, but I’m exhausted. I feel guilty even thinking about stepping back, but I also feel like I’m being pulled into their emotional spiral over and over.

Has anyone else dealt with someone who refuses help but insists they’re totally alone? How do you set boundaries without feeling like you’re abandoning them?

Any perspective or advice would be appreciated.",According_Rooster357,1,0,2025-12-02 20:58:35+00:00
