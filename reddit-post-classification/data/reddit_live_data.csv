mentalhealth,Is this considered domestic violence? I don’t know how I should’ve handled this,"My bf and I (at the time) were driving to our air bnb on vacation, it was 3 am and we were both exhausted.  I had the gps for directions and he was driving. I kept dozing off, I have never been so exhausted in my life. He was getting extremely frustrated since I had the map and kept dozing off, when I couldn’t help it. He repeatedly kept asking me for directions and I kept apologizing because it wasn’t intentional but every time he asked he was getting more and more angry. I should’ve suggested to pull over or something because there was no way I was staying awake, but the last time I did it he punched me so hard in the arm and yelled to wake up. I was shocked and angry, and we sat in silence. I got a bruise on my arm. I don’t recall if anything has ever happened like this again. 

He’s done other things to inflict trauma on me, things I’ll keep to myself, things I went to therapy for. I thought he overall cared about me but he was controlling and had narcissistic traits. I have little memories of him, I don’t know if due to the nature of our relationship, but I don’t know how I should’ve handled that. When he was angry he was scary.

mentalhealth,Parents won't take me back and everyone thinks they are in the wrong?,"So to keep things simple, I am an adopted Chinese boy who is age 15 in the US, specifically, Missouri. I was adopted at 18 months and before that I was living in an orphanage that neglected me, I have a flat back of my head and I also had a tumor on my body that was surgically removed after I was adopted. I'm also moderately underweight but was very underweight when I was a child. I have RAD, ADHD, and possibly DMDD? Also I have depression and severe anxiety and take medications for all.

  
So basically, I had a rough life and my adoptive parents and siblings were the best family I could have, however I had behavioral episodes biweekly, attempted multiple suicides, and never could hold actual relationships with my family. At 12 years old, I had a mental health crisis and was hospitalized seven times in a three month span. I kept being discharged when I wasn’t ready and I assaulted my family, officers, staff in public places, strapped to gurneys and hauled off screaming, destroying everything in my room to the point where everything had to be taken out, nailed window shut, etc. My parents couldn’t keep me safe let alone my four other siblings, (1 brother, 3 sisters. I’m the second youngest). So they had to give up custody of me in July of 2022 because they couldn’t find any long term residentials for me (mainly because of my age) and I was placed in state custody. Well, residential was fine except I never worked on my key issues, like RAD and why I felt so much hatred towards my parents and family at times. I was stepped down to a less restrictive facility in a year, but by then my behavior changed but my therapists could tell I still wasn’t ready to go home at all and my parents could tell that too. I was placed at a foster home after five months in my previous placement and by that point, its 2024, and therapy wasn’t really therapy, my parents kept getting berated and spat on by the Children’s Division because they refused to let me go through any more trauma, in case I do go beserk again.



So present day, a lot of my state team and my foster guardians say that my parents aren’t doing their job fully because they refuse to take me back home. My parents truly want me back home but they along with my siblings have suffered unimaginable trauma and my siblings are scared of me now. They don’t see any changes with my views on RAD or why I hated them so much at times, and my psych-evaluation from a year ago proved that. The state and these guardians don’t understand that what I did was that bad that my family is scared of me in the home (they still visit me though) and cannot go through any more trauma, especially after I hated being at home so much. So the state will most likely terminate rights, but it hasn’t happened yet and most people think they aren’t doing their job, they think that because they traveled across the world to adopt me, they should always work towards reunification, but what I did was so inflicting that they are scared of me in the home. 



I can provide more details if you guys have any questions, but I need some people’s perspective on this. Who is at fault here?

mentalhealth,Feel like it’s pointless,"Comparison is a the theft of joy. Feels like there has been a robbery recently. No matter how I try to distance myself from social media. As everyone 10 years younger than me has got it all figured out (34m if that matters) they are buying houses, having kids, doing the dang thing. Not just buying houses “starter” but multiple million dollars houses. 

I feel like I can’t get ahead, trying to pay off credit cards because I can’t pay them and save for a house. I can’t have kids, it’s been 7 years since my wife and I have been “careful” she hasn’t been on any birth control for over 14 years at this point. Still, no kid, no miscarriage, nothing. 

What’s the point, self harm has been very frequent in my mind. Like fuck it I’ll just let go of the wheel and drive off this cliff. If I can’t afford to own my own property, I can’t have kids. What is the point in continuing, to make someone else’s life better by working away? 

I have tried to go on hikes, start working out lost about 135 pounds, trying to treat myself better so my mind stops working against me. Nothing seems to help and I keep coming back to the same thought “what’s the point” 

If it wasn’t for my wife I prob would have ended it years ago. Also don’t think that fair for her to be the reason I keep going. Like that is a lot of pressure for someone else. I haven’t informed her of that thought as I don’t want to pressure her in thinking that if she goes away I will end it. She is a free to make the best decision for herself.

mentalhealth,Boyfriend said he is bipolar and now I’m a bit concerned,"He is on Abilify and is tapering off of it due to weight gain. We just started dating less than two months ago, and he has been very nice. My ex was a raging narcissist who showed patterns from the beginning despite lovebombing me, while this guy is pretty chill. He does take me out and is nice to me (not in an ‘I love you’ on the second date kind of way, but in a respectful, reasonable way).

He also goes to therapy, which is great. However, I am terrified of dating someone with bipolar disorder after reading some stories on this and other subs. Especially the fact that he wants to be unmedicated. I also dated someone with borderline which was probably top 5 worst decisions of my life. I can tell off the bat when someone is screw-y, but he really is a green flag. He said his last manic episode was 2017, and his father and him literally got into a physical fight.

I really think he is so sweet and cute, but I just don’t know.",feelingofficial,3,4,2025-12-02 21:08:36,2025-12-02 21:25:18.360787,,
mentalhealth,Feelings of longing and nostalgia,"Hi you!

It's my first time posting something like this but recently i found myself pretty overwhelmed regarding my emotional health. I'll tell you a story that maybe resonates with you and I'd really love to hear what your experience and views of it are.

It all started 10 years ago with my father leaving Italy for Cameroon to go work there and 'support' our family. At that point I wasn't aware of what was about to happen and how my life would evolve from being a careless funny child to being a support system for my mom and a father figure to my sister. To make it clear, my dad left home with good intentions. In the end he ended up cheating on my mother, and started a family across the world which he ended up abandoning as well. I've managed to overcome that over the years (even though we don't speak no more) and recently found myself in a pretty good place concerning my mental health. Thats at least what i thought.

Many people and many things passed since then but the thing that always remained was my endless empathy, care, and understanding of people's feelings, emotions, and actions. People's and my moms. People's and my sisters. People's and romantic relationships. But never mine.

The thing that actually encouraged me to write this post was this beautiful guy I met on my recent trip. You know that feeling when you kick it off with a person instantly? No fuss, no uncomfortable feelings, none of that weird stuff that sometimes happens during first encounters. We spent only a day together but there are no words to explain how I felt about it. Maybe the closest one would be, connected, and he said the same. You might find it weird and say 'oh well you just get attached easily', but I don't think it was like that. After I got back home we continued texting and I found out he was moving pretty soon. And then moving again in a year. We already don't live that close to eachother so throughout all that I've felt immense happiness for someone I don't know that well which has never really happened anyways.

The problem is my general feeling of hopelessness whenever I meet someone, longing for a potential thing that may never happen, and nostalgia because of thinking so far in the future. Subconsciously wishing for it to be a great big love story which, let's be real, is never realistic in situations like this. But it has also somehow made me realise that I'm not happy with where I currently physically am, meaning i despise the town I live in and feel anxious in, loathe the people I hang out with and the mentality of people i encounter in this town, and don't like the university i worked so hard to get into.

Being quite young and naïve I bought a one way ticket back to see him. We'll see what good that does or doesn't do. Am i probably making a mistake? Maybe. Am i probably going to make my feelings worse? I don't know to be honest. But what I do know is that I want to see him one more time, even if i feel like it's the beginning of an end and know it's probably going to ruin me for a while.",Fast_Engineering792,1,0,2025-12-02 21:06:52,2025-12-02 21:13:08.889492,,

mentalhealth,I feel unable to move,"Did the throwaway because I don't have anyone to talk to. I have the motivation to exercise and actually enjoy going to the gym, but I've been stuck in an episode for too long. 

I'm at a point where every movement feels unnatural and extremely strenuous. 
I often have phases in which I think against my own head because I'm literally shouted at to just end it. 

Regardless of whether it is triggered or not. I no longer know what to do, how to move forward or even how to work.

I just draw energy from the people around me who then distance themselves from me and beat me up because I'm too impulsive and stressful. 
I'm afraid of falling into another psychosis because I can't handle it 100% again. 

I just want to be able to get up and I need advice on how best to do that.

A lot of people have smaller impacts on this planet, either through friends or someone else. However I’m just wasting space. There would be no difference if I’ve never been born in the first place.

Maybe the one difference is that I’m now just a hindrance for people around me, like someone else could have lived in my house or used the seat on the bus. However because I’m taking it up it’s just getting wasted….",throwawaymeds13432,2,3,2025-12-02 20:36:07,2025-12-02 21:25:18.360832,,

mentalhealth,surviving school with MDD,"I am a 16 (almost 17) year old girl in my junior year of hs. My entire life I’ve subconsciously known that something was a little off with me mentally. I used to be really emotionally reserved even though I had many friends and I always felt that I have low self worth. It got a lot worse/apparent during Covid but then during middle school it kind of “went away” (although I now know that it never went away but rather always stayed at the back of my mind). Fast forward to the end of my sophomore year and I started skipping school because of my mental health but I was still able to keep up with my grade; I was getting A’s while taking AP classes. This year, I have taken 7 AP classes because that is what it takes to keep my rank in the top 5 percent (but now I have dropped a bit lower). In the past three weeks my mental health has gotten SIGNIFICANTLY worse and all of a sudden I have no motivation, extreme fatigue, and I am CONSTANTLY in a state of depression. Any happiness I feel is fleeting and very rare. For the first time in my life I am failing all of my classes and I have around 13 absences. I was diagnosed with MDD yesterday and I’m scared. I don’t want to fail my classes because my entire life I’ve been a straight A student and I want to go to a relatively good college. My school counselor has been no help when it comes to me keeping up with my classwork and my teachers, to my surprise, have not noticed that anything is wrong even though I went from A’s to failing (I’m talking like getting 25’s in some classes rn).

mentalhealth,im thinking about giving up. i dont know who to reach out to,"
<18 f. i had to move to england 5 or so years ago from my home country due to political issues. ever since ive arrived i have felt the pressure to try extra hard since i felt like i was born with some sort of disadvantage compared to my friends who were born and raised in this country

this has recently gotten worse with exams. i began harming myself a year ago now, and i also have other coping mechanisms which im too ashamed to admit.

i dont know what to do. ive thought about giving up multiple times. nothing i do feels enough. im never happy with my grades or my talents or my extracurriculars. i dont see a future ahead of myself. 

i dont know how healthcare works here. my parents are already struggling and i dont want them to also pay money for my mental health. the free healthcare (nhs) has long queues and i dont exactly know how it works (like ive said) at some point considering reaching out began feeling pointless too.

i feel like im becoming a bad person. i feel jealous when my friends perform well, and i cant feel sorry for them when they vent about their problems (because in my head ""what theyre experiencing is nowhere bad enough"") i never tell this to them. i dont want to hurt the people around me but i can understand that these are not good thoughts to have. i am insecure.

i doubt many people will see this. i dont really know why im posting this here. it just feels like im living a life that nobody else can relate to and nobody else can truly understand. i just want to be happy with myself and i tried so hard to but i cant. im tired.

im meant to map out a future for myself by now. focus on my academics, my connections, my skills. but i cant see one for myself at all. my life feels like a waste

it makes me jealous of other women, and i hate that feeling. i’ve become so bitter watching everyone else be prettier, like there’s no point in my life if i look like this.

and it’s not just appearance. i feel stupid, like my personality is awful. i don’t really have close friends. just one, and we’re not that close. i’ve never had a boyfriend either, and it just makes me feel like my life is already over before it even started.

i’ve been feeling like this for around 3 years. i know therapy would probably help but i’m honestly terrified of going, and the therapists around where i live don’t seem great anyway.

mentalhealth,"Incident happened with mom, now I am remembering things.","I am 43(M) if that matters. 

About a month ago, I went to my parents' house to visit my mom. I knew dad was at work, but was just stopping by to say hello. Walked in on mom with another man. Anger instantly went through the roof, I told the guy to get dressed and get TF out. 

I yelled at mom, very harshly. She needed to hear those words, and after I left I have not been in contact with her whatsoever. Dad is doing OK.  Much better than I would be in this situation. 

  
It took me a solid two weeks to calm my mind down about that situation to be able to form rational thoughts about things. In doing this, bits and pieces from the past, say when I was age 7 - 12 keep popping into my mind, and when thinking about them now, it sure seems like mom has been cheating on dad for a while. 

  
I keep having random memories come out now since that day, and I don't know how to feel about it. Is my own personal mental health collapsing? I can still function just fine daily, it just is worrisome that I can just be plugging away at work and all of a sudden, my brain is in 1992 and a confused kid.  Easy enough to snap out of, but it is something I am not familiar with. 

Is this common after an incident like this?

  
Thanks for reading.

mentalhealth,Point of life?,"Hi, I'm 15, struggling with mental health. My life feels very difficult at the moment and I actually just wanna know what I'm doing all this for?

I'm not religious, I don't believe in any god and don't want to. (For very good reasons. But I'm not in the mood to have discussions about that)

What's the point of life? Why am I here

I'm sorry if this is the wrong community to post this in but idk where else to post it.

Idk if this helps: I'm in therapy and taking medication prescribed by my psychiatrist. I have an autistic burnout. I'm always overstimulated, that's what the meds are for, but they don't help. I think i have social anxiety and now I'm too scared to go to school. the anxiety makes my burnout worse. 
I don't have any hobbies, I spend my days lying in bed or walking around my room while listening to music. I don't enjoy doing anything and I don't have friends. There's nothing I look forward to which makes it quite difficult to wanna live, so I REALLY need a reason to live or a point in life.


Sorry if this is chaotic, my brain is just kinda like that atm",2002VE68,7,3,2025-12-02 14:42:00,2025-12-02 21:25:18.360810,,

mentalhealth,Bf’s mom covered my mouth while im having panic attacks. Is that abuse?,"Hi everyone. I really need an outside perspective because I feel shaken, confused, and honestly scared. I’m staying with my family right now, trying to process everything.

A few days ago I had a severe panic attack, the worst one I’ve ever had. Honestly idk becahse it was my first time experiencing it. My whole body froze up, I couldn’t move, I was crying uncontrollably, and I felt like I couldn’t breathe. I genuinely thought I was going to pass out. I thought i was having a stroke because my mom and grandpa had it. No one in the family has ever had mental health issues like panic attack so this is new to me.

My boyfriend tried to “handle” me for about an hour, but then he suddenly got frustrated. I kept begging him to take me to the hospital because I couldn’t breathe or move, but he refused. My mom lives 3 hours away and called him in the middle of the night, telling him to take me to the ER immediately — he still refused. He insisted I’d “be better at home” and told me he didn’t want to “wait in line at the ER for this.”

I told him I was terrified and begged, “Please don’t leave me alone, I’m scared,” and he said, “No, I’m tired of dealing with you.” Then he left me alone, closed the door, and almost turned off all the lights while I was frozen and screaming for help.

I kept crying and yelling that I couldn’t breathe. He eventually came back, not to help, but to yell: “Are you trying to get me arrested?! You’re waking the basement tenants!”

The next morning things got even worse. His mom came over, immediately yelling at me while I was still shaking, crying, and unable to move properly. At one point she said, “If you don’t stop, I’m going to slap you,” and then she covered my mouth with her hand while I was crying and struggling to breathe. And said oh you need to be taken away and be in a psych for a week.

I can’t describe how terrifying that felt. I literally could not move, can’t stop crying even though my brain wants to stop and someone put their hand over my mouth.

When my body slipped partly off the bed, they laughed and said, “Oh, now you can move.” His mom kept provoking me by saying, “What do you want to do, punch me?” “Go ahead punch me right now” while I could barely talk.

My boyfriend eventually said you can’t treat her like how you treat me. And she was flabbergasted. After i was taken to the hospital which was 12 hrs after the incident even though i was begging for 12 hrs to take me to the hospital, my family came to get me. So i slept with my family the whole time after. The next day he messaged me and said, “If you weren’t being a bitch, you’d be comfortable in bed and jn the office in the house right now.” In a very sarcastic tone.

I left and I’m staying with my family now. I don’t feel safe going back, but I also feel confused and guilty. I keep replaying everything and questioning myself.

Was this abuse? Or am I overreacting because I was scared and having a panic attack? They kept saying to me that they just didnmt know how to handle it that’s why thats there reaction. I genuinely need honest perspective",Psychological_Ant747,63,61,2025-12-02 12:09:17,2025-12-02 21:25:18.360747,,

mentalhealth,Are men under 30 ruined?,"I’m in my early 50s. White dude from a small farm town. My generation had its problems. Divorce. Alcoholism. Drug abuse. Bullying. Abusive parents. Dysfunctional extended family. School authorities were corrupt. Cops sucked. The most repugnant edgelords of my generation were probably Nirvana and Beavis and Butthead - both culturally cataclysmic. They seemed to point out a problem with cathartic noise or a healthy sense of humor. But being stupid, ignorant or mean was never a cause to be celebrated. The cultural implication seemed to be that those traits were still meant to be resisted and aged out of. Until then, skateboarding and playing rock ‘n’ roll would get me through.

It was a fucking paradise compared to now. I’m speaking of the post-internet reality for young men specifically.

The lives of men raised online seem to have been completely retarded. Their lives were deprived of the development of mirror neurons or authentic chances to experience empathy or whatever family system they grew up in was completely usurped by the internet and video games and people behaving very, very, very badly online. Either way, the result seems to be that their moral compass is based on the indulgence of other people’s worst fantasies.

Now it is completely normal for someone to go online and spew the most dissociated, vile hate I’ve ever had the displeasure of being witness to.

Nirvana and Beavis and Butthead gave way to the “I don’t care if you don’t care” attitude of the 2000s which gave way to 4Chan and the celebration of not just ignorance, but of abject cruelty. I argue it's what has landed us here.

I know that there are always generational divides. I’m aware that this could be construed simply as a “get off my lawn” letter. But I always have always advocated for kids - especially when other adults didn't. ""Adults"" don’t know what they’re doing most of the time anyway.

But this recent thing - this is not “you crazy kids with your loud music and your long hair running off to rock concerts, getting drunk on the weekends or dropping out of school to travel in Europe.” It’s not “I’m worried about this rap or Satanic Heavy Metal music you listen to” or “you play too much Nintendo - go outside and ride your bike.”

This is celebrating Hitler. Incels. Groypers. It’s the glorification of hate and the killing of other people - specifically the most vulnerable among us.

This seems to be a completely ubiquitous epidemic of mental illness the likes of which we have never seen as a species, but it seems to be the only perceivable reality for certain young men.

Entire generations are throwing their lives into the meat grinder of a 24 hour news cycle. Seems to me that's nothing but a dark fiction with a shit ending for everyone. But I also don’t see this going away with the wisdom of old age. I argue that we either fix this or we fix nothing.

Young men - am I wrong or right? If so, please tell me why.",[deleted],172,134,2025-12-02 07:17:07,2025-12-02 21:25:18.360730,,

mentalhealth,"My college roommate’s porn addiction spiraled so badly he got kicked out of the dorms, and I still don’t know how to process it","So… this is something I never expected to write, but after everything that happened this semester, I need to get it out of my system.

I go to a pretty normal mid-sized university. Nothing fancy. At the start of the year, housing assigned me a random roommate—let’s call him *D*. When we first met, he seemed quiet, awkward, but friendly enough. He was a comp-sci major who mostly kept to himself, liked energy drinks a little too much, and played a ton of gacha games. Honestly, he reminded me of half the guys I know.

Everything seemed normal for the first month. He’d stay up late, but whatever—college. Then slowly… things got weird.

At first, I noticed he’d close his laptop really fast whenever I walked in. Again… fine. We’re all adults. But it kept happening. Sometimes at 3–4 AM when I’d wake up to use the bathroom and see the glow of his screen. Then I started finding tissues on the desk, earbuds on the floor, his laptop open with incognito tabs still visible. Awkward, but not a crisis… until it escalated.

The dude stopped going to class. Not just here and there—like WEEKS at a time. He barely left the room except to grab vending machine snacks. I’d come back from lectures and hear… very obvious audio coming from behind his headphones. Even when I made noise, even when I said I was entering. He just didn’t care anymore.

The turning point was when our RA did room inspections.

I had warned him the night before, and he said “yeah yeah, don’t worry.” Spoiler: he absolutely *did not* worry.

The RA knocked, we said come in, and D—**I swear to god**—still had a video playing on his screen. Full volume because his headphones had unplugged slightly. The RA just froze. I froze. D froze about two seconds later when he realized it wasn’t me who walked in.

The RA told him to close it, but you could tell he was trying to be professional while dying inside.

After that, we got a meeting scheduled with housing. I thought he’d get a warning. What I *didn’t* know was that this wasn’t D’s first report.

Apparently other people on our floor had complained earlier about weird noises through the walls, late-night slamming sounds, and someone seeing explicit content on his screen through the door window when walking past. They had talked to him before and he brushed it off.

Housing sent him to counseling. He skipped. They set up another meeting. He didn’t go. They warned him he could lose his dorm privileges if he kept violating behavior rules.

He kept doing it.

Fast-forward a bit: two weeks later, at around midnight, he was watching stuff with the volume ON—like, full speakers—because he “thought I wouldn’t be back for a while.” Someone on our floor called the RA again. This time it went straight up the chain.

Three days later, he was officially removed from on-campus housing for repeated conduct violations and refusing to comply with the support plan they tried to create for him. They gave him 24 hours to pack and leave.

It left me weirdly shaken. I can’t tell if I feel sorry for him, frustrated, secondhand embarrassed, or all of the above.

Anyway… thanks to anyone who actually read all this. I just needed to unload the story somewhere.",Levitating_Moose,297,40,2025-12-01 20:27:28,2025-12-02 21:25:18.360780,,
